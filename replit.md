# Overview

LoboHub is a comprehensive family hub web application built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application serves as a centralized digital platform for families to manage tasks, lists, calendars, budgets, meal planning, devotionals, events, and real-time chat communication. The system implements a sophisticated family-based sharing model where content can be either private to individual users or shared across family members.

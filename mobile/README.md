# LoboHub Mobile - Fixed Configuration

## Version Compatibility Fixed
- Updated from Expo SDK 51 to SDK 53 to match running environment
- Updated React Native to compatible version
- Simplified dependencies to essential components only

## Current Status
- ✅ Package.json updated with compatible versions
- ✅ App.json configured for SDK 53
- ✅ Minimal App.js with basic React Native components
- ✅ Clean babel configuration

## To Test:
1. Stop any running Expo server
2. Run `npm start` in mobile directory
3. Scan QR code with Expo Go

Should now show "LoboHub Mobile" interface without SDK compatibility errors.
